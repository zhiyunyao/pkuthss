## Overview
This project provides a lite LaTeX template designed for formatting dissertations at Peking University.

With the document class rewritten and APIs redefined, this template incorporates previous endeavors [CasperVector/pkuthss](https://github.com/CasperVector/pkuthss) and [iofu728/pkuthss](https://github.com/iofu728/pkuthss), supports additional functionalities, and maintains a more uniform and consistent coding style throughout the template.
It is finely tuned for seamless integration with popular editors like `VSCode` and `Overleaf`, offering users a convenient solution for academic document preparation.

Note that the `tex` files using previous templates need to be carefully updated due to the API changes.

## Quick Start
- Within `VSCode`: Download the project and open it with VSCode. Note that the VSCode extension, LaTeX Workshop, need to be properly configured before compiling.
- Within `Overleaf`: Copy the Overleaf project at https://www.overleaf.com/read/wmsmytgjkxfy#c888f2 to your own account.
See also `userguide.pdf` for details.
